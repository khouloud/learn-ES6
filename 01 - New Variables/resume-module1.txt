Comments / resume (var, let and const)

1. var variables are function scoped (variable locale) and can be updated or redefined
2. let and const variables are scoped to the block statement {...}
3. const variables cannot be updated versus let variables can be updated by simply reassign the variable without putting let before
4. const on a object works differently you cannot assign new attributes to the object but you can change their value!
